# Rainfall Prediction

This project aims to predict rainfall based on historical weather data. The dataset contains information about various weather parameters, and the goal is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebook for data analysis, preprocessing, and model training.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- **requirements.txt**: List of required Python packages.
